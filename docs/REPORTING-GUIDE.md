- Slightly more interest paid
- Best for: Users who need momentum and encouragement

| Strategy | Months to Payoff | Total Interest | Recommended For |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Avalanche | 36 months | $2,500 | Maximum savings |
| Snowball | 38 months | $2,800 | Quick motivation |
| Difference | 2 months | $300 | — |

### Redirecting Gambling Savings
